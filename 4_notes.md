##To Fix Before Release

1. Remove visible references to Reservations, Accounts, Billing, and
   Invoices. [DONE]

2. Need to either hide or document the ability to whitelist Networks.
   [DONE: limitation documented below]

3. Hide undocumented Views. Keep only Tenant, Developer, Nagios, and 
   xsh. [DONE]

4. Complete Site Privilges (Admin, Tech, PI, Default) or document as
   incomplete. [DONE: limitation documented below]

5. Nodes tab should be visible from the Sites page. [DONE]

6. Tags tab should not be visible from the Sites page (only from
   Slices). [DONE]

7. Finish the example Acceess Control policy language example in the
   Administering a Deployment section.

8. Why does the Deployment page include both an Images selector and
   an Images tab. Seems like the latter is unnecessary. If that's not
   the case, document the tab. [DONE]

9. Make sure user's can't set/unset Admin and Read-Only buttons in
   Login Details without the proper authorization. (And do we really
   need Read-Only any more?)

10. Users->Dashboard View != the set of views visible on the user's
   home page (and does not reflect changes made through the Customize
   tab).

11. Slice objects should not be saved if creator is not set. A
    non-admin should not be able to set the creator to someone else.

12. Determine if Sliver.IP is a useful field or redundant with
    NetworkSlivers. Update admin to display the appropriate one (right
    now we display comma-separated NetworkSlivers addresses in Sliver
    list, but Sliver.IP in Sliver detail view)

##Incomplete and Undocumented Features

1. There is only partial support for ServiceClass object.
   BestEffort is the only available class, and related objects
   (e.g., Reservations, Accounts, Invoices) are incomplete. 
   The relationship between the BestEffort class and Flavors
   needs attention.

2. Two Networks are automatically created and assigned to every
   Slice. There is sufficient support to create new networks, bind
   them to a slice, and whitelist other slices that are allowed to
   connect to a network, but the workflow is brittle and not
   documented.

3. A current limitation is that only one user key is injected into the
   slice. That user can login and manually add the keys of other users,
   but an OpenCloud admin also needs to add the keys to the account used
   to support proxy login to the slice.
   Related to this limitation, the current Default SlicePrivilege needs
   attention should mean "no special slice privilege" whereas a new
   SlicePrivlige (let's call it "User") means the user's key has been
   installed and he or she may ssh into the slice's slivers.

4. The full range of SitePrivileges is not implemented. Only Admin 
   (currently named "PI") is supported, as opposed to Admin, Tech,
   and PI.

5. OVX installation is currently disjoint from the OpenStack
   installation.  Eventually, OVX (and the corresponding Neutron
   plugin) will be installed as part of OpenStack via Juju.

6. Need to automate the binding of interfaces to images.

7. For slivers attached to a "Dedicated public IP" network, the IP address
   and SSH command shown on the Sliver Details page are both incorrect.
