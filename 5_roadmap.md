##Immediate Fixes and Upgrades

1. For slivers attached to a "Dedicated public IP" network, the IP
   address and SSH command shown on the Sliver Details page are both
   incorrect.

2. Automate the binding of interfaces to images.

3. Enhance and document Developer View's VN management interface.

4. Complete full range of Site Privilges.

5. Automatically manage multiple user keys pers slice.

6. SlicePrivilege=Default should mean the user may ssh into the
   slice's slivers (not "no special privilege"). Rename "Default" to
   "User".

7. Relation between ServiceClass and Flavor need attention.
