This section records high-level the plan of record, but is typically
less detailed than information on the
[Development Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/xosproject.org/forum/#!forum/devel).
Also see bug reports and short-term feature requests filed at the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/open-cloud/xos/issues).

##Priorities for Burwell Release (September 2015)

1. Configuration Management. The goal is to remove deployment
dependencies from the code base so we can support multiple deployments
(e.g., CORD, OpenCloud) from a common git branch. Also use Docker to
simplify the development environment.

2. Tenancy Model. The goal is to codify the tenancy model that came
out of the CORD proof-of-concept.

3. Reconcile with OpenStack. The goal is to eliminate gratuitous
differences between XOS and OpenStack (e.g., Instances instead of Slivers).

4. Upgrade to OpenStack Kilo.

5. New Observer/Synchronizer Framework. The goal is to transition to
a more robust and complete Observer,  which we will likely rename as
the Synchronizer. Sub-goals include: (a) better integration of
Ansible, and (b) support inter-model plugins (e.g., HPC and OpenStack).

6. Instrumentation-as-a-Service. The goal is to incorporate
OpenStack's Ceilometer into XOS, making it available as a first-class
XOS service that other services (and views) and use.

##Deployments

1. Migrate additional ViCCI servers to OpenCloud.

2. Configure "Dev POD" for CORD.
