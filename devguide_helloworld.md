## Introduction

This document walks through the implementation of a simple HelloWorld service
on the XOS platform. It provides a technical overview of the service and its
components, as well as instructions for setting it up.

The HelloWorld service displays the concatenation of two strings in a web page,
where the user (tenant) of the service specifies the two strings. The service
then sets up a new Instance (VM), and configures it to install the Apache web
server at the time of its first start up. The server then displays the two
strings specified by the user of the service in a web page.

The current version of HelloWorld is minimal. It includes a single instance for
the whole service and it does not synchronize changes to the strings. We plan
to expand the example over time to illustrate additional features.

## Setting Up the Service

The following assumes a working XOS installation. See the [Configuration
Management](/devguide/configmgmt/) section of the Developer Guide for
instructions on installing XOS. The "Devel Config" is sufficient for setting up
and running  the HelloWorld service.

To set up HelloWorld, follow the steps below. Unless otherwise specified, file
and /opt/xos directory paths are relative to the XOS installation directory:


1.  Register HelloWorld as an add­on component by adding the string
    `helloworld` to the list INSTALLED_APPS in the file `xos/settings.py`. This
    variable should contain the list of preconfigured services in XOS.

```
'services.onos',
'ceilometer',
'helloworld',
'requestrouter',
'syndicate_storage'
```

2.  Add the service's models to the database using Django's automatic
     migration feature:

{% highlight sh %}
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
{% endhighlight %}

3.  Generate a dependency map for the service. The dependency map links objects
    in the HelloWorld service to objects in other services, such as the VM
    management core service.

{% highlight sh %}
$ ./dmdot helloworld > helloworld­deps
$ cp helloworld­deps model­deps
{% endhighlight %}

4. Restart the xos platform services:
 
{% highlight sh %}
$ supervisorctl restart observer
$ scripts/opencloud stopserver
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, your docker container should have exited, in which case, you would need to restart it. Note the container id in the output of the first command, and then run it: 

{% highlight sh %}
$ docker ps ­a  
$ docker run <container id>
{% endhighlight %}

## Using the Service

To deploy the HelloWorld service, first set up a Slice, and create an Instance
within that slice. That instance will be copied into a new one to host the
HelloWorld service.

To deploy a new instance of the HelloWorld service, go to the XOS portal at
URL: `http://<xos­head­node>/helloworld`

Next, configure the two strings with values of your choice. These strings are
not interpreted. They are displayed in the output of the service as is. When
you have entered the submitted the form, you should see a new instance appear
within your slice.  The Instance should automatically be set up with the
HelloWorld service, namely the Apache web service configured to display the
strings you entered in the Service creation form.

To test the service, go to the following address in your web browser:
`http://<ip address of VM>/hello.txt`

You can find out the IP address of your VM by looking in the list of Instances
in your slice. If your instances are configured with private IP addresses (as
is the case on CloudLab), consider using the lynx web browser to see the output
of the service:

{% highlight sh %}
$ apt-get -y install lynx  
$ lynx http://<ip address of VM>/hello.txt
{% endhighlight %}

## Components

The HelloWorld service has three main components: a set of one or more *Models* that define the authoritative state for the service, a *Synchronizer* that keeps the back­end system that implements the service in sync with this state, and a *View* that provides an
interface to the service.

The models, which are used to extend the XOS data model, can be found in the
file [helloworld/models.py](https://github.com/open-cloud/xos/blob/master/xos/services/helloworld/models.py) ; the synchronizer is under
[synchronizers/helloworld](https://github.com/open-cloud/xos/tree/master/xos/synchronizers/helloworld), and the view is in [helloworld/views.py](https://github.com/open-cloud/xos/blob/master/xos/services/helloworld/view.py).The
following discusses each of the three components in more detail.

### Models

The XOS data model consists of a set of core models (e.g., instances, networks,
slices, services, deployments) and a collection of service­specific models
(e.g., HyperCache, ONOS, Syndicate, Ceilometer). These latter models hold a
collection of configuration values and control parameters for the corresponding
service. In the case of the HelloWorld service, there are two objects (Django
models): Hello and World. Both of these objects contain a string in the field
"name." The HelloWorld service displays the concatenation of these two strings
in a web page.

These two objects also contain links to other objects. The World object
contains a link to the Hello object, through the "hello" field. This link is an
illustration of an intra­service dependency. Through the dependency map
generated in Step 3 of the setup, the operation of the service is constrained
so that dependent Hello objects are made operational ("synchronized") before
World objects.

The Hello object contains a link to an Instance object, which represents a
provisioned virtual machine. The name of the field, `instance_backref`,
contains the suffix `_backref` to indicate a reversal of the polarity of the
dependency. Instead of defining a link from Hello to Instance, it makes
Instance objects depend on Hello objects. The outcome of this dependency is to
guarantee that Hello objects are synchronized before their accompanying
Instance objects. This ordering is a requirement for the Hello World service,
since Instances are preconfigured with the packages they need to contain, and
the content that they are to serve.

### Synchronizer

The Synchronizer makes the service operational. It does this by
converting the configuration specified in the data models into
directives for the back­end platform. This corresponds to
bringing up VMs, configuring those VMs, and issuing commands
to the OS.

For each object (Django model), the synchronizer contains a synchronization step.
There are two parts to each step: a Python wrapper that acts a as a translator between
the service's abstract configuration and the concrete configuration of the back­end
system, and an Ansible playbook that actually communicates the latter configuration to
the back­end. More details on the anatomy of the synchronizer and its steps can be
Developer Guide. The following looks at the HelloWorld synchronizer in  more detail.

The goal of the HelloWorld synchronizer is to instantiate a new VM with an Apache Web
server installed, and drop in a web page containing text provided by the user. Since it
relies on the the core VM management service in the [openstack_synchronizer/]() directory
to instantiate Instances, the HelloWorld synchronizer does not contain any Ansible
modules itself. Instead, it feeds values to the Instance synchronizer. Specifically, it adds
instructions to "user_data", a set of configuration directives to the "cloud­init"
initialization daemon.

{% highlight yaml %}
nova_compute:
  auth_url: {{ "{{ endpoint " }}}}
  login_username: {{ "{{ admin_user " }}}}
  login_password: {{ "{{ admin_password " }}}}
  login_tenant_name: {{ "{{ admin_tenant " }}}}
  name: {{ "{{ name " }}}}
  {{"{% if delete -" }}%}
  state: absent
  {{"{% else -" }}%}
  state: present
  availability_zone: {{ "{{ availability_zone " }}}}
  image_name: {{ "{{ image_name " }}}}
  wait_for: 200
  flavor_name: {{ "{{ flavor_name " }}}}
  user_data: "{{ "{{ user_data " }}}}"
  config_drive: yes
{% endhighlight %}

The instructions for installing the Apache web server and adding a web page to be
served are implemented as follows.

```
sync_hello.py:
instance.userData="packages:\n  ­ apache2\nruncmd:\n  ­ update­rc.d apache2
enable\n  ­ service apache2 start\nwrite_files:\n­   content: Hello %s\n    path:
/var/www/html/hello.txt"%record.name
instance.save()
```


### View

The user­facing interface to configuring a service is called a view. It takes
inputs from a user and creates the appropriate XOS objects to represent the
desired behavior. The View is written in Python using Django, and intercepts
and responds to HTTP requests.  The View for the helloworld service is
implemented in the file [helloworld/views.py](https://github.com/open-cloud/xos/blob/master/xos/services/helloworld/view.py).

Note that this example view is minimal. A more complete description of how to
construct a view can be found in the [Adding Views](/devguide/addview/) to XOS
section of the Developer Guide.

A new mechanism to auto­generate views is under development. This section will
be updated to use this new mechanism once it is ready.
