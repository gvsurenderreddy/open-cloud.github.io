title: Developer Guide
---

This guide describes how to contribute to the XOS core, as well as to
extend XOS with new services and views. It also documents modeling and
naming conventions, and describes the development and testing
environments we use.

When necessary for clarity of exposition, this guide uses examples
from OpenCloud for illustrative purposes. For example, on OpenCloud
the XOS server process is started in directory
`/opt/xos/scripts/opencloud`. Substitute local specifics for an
alternative XOS installation.
