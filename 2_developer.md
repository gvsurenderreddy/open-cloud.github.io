##Django Migration Notes

This section discusses Django database migration. For a general
overview of migrtion considerations, see
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/

When adding a new field to the data model, execute the following two
steps:

1. python manage.py makemigrations
2. python manage.py migrate

The first step creates the migration scripts automatically. These will
be placed in core/migrations/, hpc/migrations/,
syndicate_service/migrations/, and so on. The second step
automatically runs all migration scripts as necessary to bring the
data model from any previous state up to the current state.

Migration scripts are numbered, and they have dependency information
encoded into them. For example, migration script 0003 usually depends
on script 0002, which depends on 0001, and so on. For this reason it
is important that you check your migration scripts into git, and that
you pull others' migration scripts before running makemigrations
(otherwise multiple developers will end up creating conflciting or
redundant scripts). Note that these migration scripts work much like
the SQL migrations used for MyPLC.

Notable changes in Django 1.7:

1. "syncdb" is now a synonym for "migrate"

2. "syncdb" (and migrate) no longer automatically install
initial_data.json. To compensate, scripts/opencloud has been modified
to perform a "loaddata" whenever the database is created for the very
first time.

3. django.setup needs to be called by external scripts before using
models. planetstack-backend.py has been modified to do this
automatically.

Upgrading from Django 1.5 to Django 1.7 was messy, so it could be
messy inside of peoples' private planetstacks as well. It may be
necessary to fully uninstall Django and it's related packages

```
pip uninstall django djangorestframework django-filter django-timezones django-crispy-forms django-geoposition django-extensions django-suit django-evolution django-bitfield django-ipware django-encrypted-fields
```

and then reinstall them

```
pip install django==1.7 djangorestframework django-filter django-timezones django-crispy-forms django-geoposition django-extensions django-suit django-evolution django-bitfield django-ipware django-encrypted-fields
```

Django's migration will get upset if you attempt to have an unmigrated
app that depends on a migrated app, for example, in Foreign Key
relationships or model inheritance. Most of our apps have such a
dependency between the 'Service' object in the app and
core.Service. When creating new apps, run 

```
python manage.py makemigrations <appname>
```
to create the initial migration for the app.

##Data Model Conventions

###Modeling Basics

We first establish Django terminology, and how it relates to common
object-related terminology. An Object Class is called a Model in
Django. A Django Model consists of a set of Fields (equivalent to
saying an Object Class is defined by a set of Attributes). Each Django
Field has a Type and each Type has a set of Attributes. Some of these
Attributes are core (common across all Types) and some are
Type-specific. Relationships between Models are expressed by Fields
with one of a set of distinguished relationship-oriented Types (e.g,
OneToOneField). Finally, an Object is an instance (instantiation of) a
Model, where each Object has a unique primary key (or more precisely,
a primary index into the table that implements the Model). By
convention, that index/key should be the Django AutoField id which is
automatically created for any Model that has not identified a separate
unique primary key. The Django default primary key is always "id" for
system level tables, and "pk" for model tables.

####Field Types

There are various built in Fields that may be specified at Class
declaration. The basic field types commonly in use with OpenCloud:

| FieldType          | Why to Use It?     |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| BooleanField       | Displays as a checkbox in GUI; limits input to valid possibilities. If None is a valid option, please use *NullBooleanField* which uses default widget of choice: None, Yes, No.|
| CharField          | Allows for String representation, additional required attributes are "max_length". This should be used for small to large size strings. For mulitiple sentences, use TextField.|
| DateTimeField      | Special field that maps to python DateTime. May set optional attributes of *auto_now* (update field each time it is saved), *auto_add_now* (update field when created only) |
| EmailField         | Automatically checks for well formed Emails based on RFC3696/5321. Note that for full compliance we need to set the length to 254; default is 75. [**This is a bug in our model.**] |
| FloatField         | Used to represent a real number; default widget is TextInput.|
| IntegerField       | Used to represent Integer values; default widget is TextInput. [**We should review whether the IntegerFields should be changed to be PositiveIntegers, or PositiveSmalls accordingly.**]|
| GenericIPAddressField | Able to validate IPv4 and IPv6 flavors of addresses; default widget is TextInput.|
| URLField           | Verifies well formed URL, max_length is defaulted to 200.  GUI convenience is that the value of the field is displayed as a clickable link above the input widget.|
| SlugField          | Used to represent a short label for something containing only letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens. This should be used for the name of Tags so that there is a better chance of promoting the Tag to be an actual field attribute once the model has been solidified.|
	
####Core Field Attributes

List of Field level optional attributes currently in use:

| Attribute          | Effect             |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| verbose_name="..." | Provides a label to be used in the GUI display for this field. Differs from the field name itself, which is used to create the column in the database table.|
| verbose_name_plural="..." | Way to override the verbose name for this field.|
| help_text="..." | Provides some context-based help for the field; will show up in the GUI display.|
| default=... | Allows a predefined default value to be specified.|
| choices=CHOICE_LIST | An interable (list or tuple). Allows the field to be filled in from an enumerated choice. For example, *ROLE_CHOICES = (('admin', 'Admin'), ('pi', 'Principle Investigator'), ('user','User'))*|
| unique=True |	Requires that the field be unique across all entries.|
| blank=True | Allows the field to be present but empty.|
| null=True | Allows the field to have a value of null if the field is blank.|
| editable=False | If you would like to make this a readOnly field to the user.|
	 
List of Field level optional attributes we should not use, or use judiciously:

| Attribute          | Why                |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| primary_key        | Some of the plugins we use, particularly in the REST area, do not do well with CharField's as the primary key. In general, it is best to use the system primary key instead, and put a *db_index=True, unique=True* on the CharField you would have used.|
| db_column, db_tablespace | Convention is to use the Field name as the db column, and use verbose_name if you want to change the display. For tablespace, all models should be defined within the application they are specified in -- overwriting the tablespace will make it more challenging for the next developer to find and fix any issues that might arise.|

List of Field level optional attributes we will likely need/want to
use:

| Attribute          | Effect             |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| db_index=True      | Allows for quicker queries if you are going to order by, or filter by, the specified field.|
| error_messages={...} | Pass in a dictionary of error keys, and the message you want to display if the error occurs.  For example: null, blank, invalid, invalid_choice, and unique. Other error messages may be present per FieldType.|
| validators=[...]      | Allows a list of validators to be run before committing the value of this field to the model (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/validators/).|

####Expressing Relationships

There are a few different types of Relationship based fields offered
in Django.

| FieldType          | When to Use it     |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| ForeignKeyField    | Used to represent a 1-to-Many relationship. For example: Sliver’s may have 1 and only 1 Node; Node’s may have 0 or more Slivers. Can also be used to represent recursive relationships for the same object types by providing ‘self’ as the relationship (first position) parameter.|
| ManyToManyField    | Used to represent an N-to-N relationship. For example: Deployments may have 0 or more Sites; Sites may have 0 or more Deployments.|
| OneToOneField      | Not currently in use, but would be useful for applications that wanted to augment a core class with their own additional settings. This has the same affect as a ForeignKey with unique=True.  The difference is that the reverse side of the relationship will always be 1 object (not a list).|
| GenericForeignKey | Not currently in use, but can be used to specify a non specific relation to "another object." Meaning object A relates to any other object.  This relationship requires a reverse attribute in the “other” object to see the relationship -- but would primarily be accessed through the GenericForeignKey owner Model. For example, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#id1. The nuances of these relationships is brought about by the additional optional attributes that can be ascribed to each Field.|

Note that we should likely convert our Tags to use GenericForeignKey
so that all objects can be extensible during development, but then
converted/promoted to attributes once the model has stabilized.

####Optional Attribute Side Effects

| Attribute          | Key Type           | Why                |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| limit_choices_to   | ForeignKeyField, ManyToManyField | Not currently in use. Good to limit the possible selection choices for a remote relationship by some constraint.  Constraints may either be expressed by a dictionary of lookups, or by a Q object. (See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q.) Example of data limit for another object: *limit_choices_to = {'pub_date__lte': datetime.date.today}*|
| relate_name        | ForeignKeyField, ManyToManyField | The name to use for the relation back to this one.  This is extremely useful both to provide additional context in the way the objects are related but also when you have the same objects and object types related in different contexts to the same instance. It allows for lookups and incorporation into Admin Forms based on the relationship. For example, *SliceMembership: user = models.ForeignKey('User', related_name='slice_memberships') slice = models.ForeignKey('Slice', related_name='slice_memberships')*. "+" is a special meaning in this field. As the only character (or the trailing character of the field) it has the effect of eclipsing the backward relationship so that it is unseen by the related object.|
| on_delete          | ForeignKeyField | Default behavior is to behave like "ON DELETE CASCADE." This may be turned of so long as the *null=True, blank=True* options are also set. For example, *user = models.ForeignKey(User, blank=True, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)*|
| symmetrical        | ManyToManyField | Only used when ManyToManyField definition is against "self." For example, *class Person: friends = models.ManyToManyField("self")* would mean that if Person Alice is friended to Person Brian, then Brian is also Friends with Alice.|
| through            | ManyToManyField | Django automatically creates a mapping table for ManyToMany relationships. By using this field, you can specify the exact mapping table you would like to use, therefore allowing you to augment/extend that table with additional data. For example, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#intermediary-manytomany.|
| parent_link        | OneToOneField | Used only for multiple inheritance (specifically from a concrete class) to avoid additional/extra OneToOneFields being created via subclassing. Django documentation for Related Fields can be found at: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#module-django.db.models.fields.related.|

####Avoid List

Avoid using the following optional attributes as they can have adverse
effects on data integrity and REST relationships:

| Attribute          | Effect             |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| to_field           | Would allow the relationship to exist against a field other than the primary key in the remote object.|
| db_constraint      | Controls whether or not a constraint should be created in the database for the foreignKey relationship. It defaults to True. If you set it to False you could cause database pointers to non-existent data. We should avoid this.|

###Model-Specific MetaData

| Model Setting      | When to use it     |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| abstract           | Used to specify that the defined model is not intended/able to be instantiated directly. For example, PlCoreBase, which is used to ensure that created, updated, and enacted fields will be provided for all OpenCloud participating objects.|
| app_label          | Necessary if models are defined in modules other than models.py  In our core application we split out the model definitions into their own modules for clarity -- each of the models not derived from the PlCoreBase needs to explicitly state the “core” as the application this object is associated to. For example, PlCoreBase and User.|
| order_with_respect_to | |
| ordering | Defines the default column to order lists of the object type by. For example, Users => email.|

###Model CheckList

After creating a new model, here are the additional changes required
for your new model to fully take effect and be visible in OpenCloud:

| Where to go        | Why                |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| /opt/planetstack/core/models/__init__.py | Add your new model into the python package.|
| /opt/planetstack/core/admin.py | Register your model with the admin interface, until this is complete your model will not be visible in the Admin interface. For example, *admin.site.register(Deployment)*. You may also want a custom Admin Page rather than the auto-generated page so that you can tailor the view to just the fields and display widgets you prefer. To do that use *admin.site.register(Deployment, DeploymentAdmin)* and see the Tips and Tricks for GUI Views for more detailed instructions.|
| /opt/planetstack/planetstack/urls.py | REST related. Add in the url paths to tie in to callbacks for CRUD. Typically there are 2 different urls to expose: (1) Creation at the directory/container level to handle POST commands; and (2) RetrieveUpdateDestroy path based on GET|PUT|DELETE commands. For example, *url(r'^plstackapi/sites/$', SiteListCreate.as_view(), name='site-list')*, *url(r'^plstackapi/sites/(?P<pk>[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+)/$', SiteRetrieveUpdateDestroy.as_view(), name='site-detail')*.|
| /opt/planetstack/core/views | REST related. Add classes to support the Create, Read, Update and Destroy needs for your new model when it is accessed via REST.|
| /opt/planetstack/core/serializers.py | REST related. Add a class to specify the fields that are exposed via the REST api for your model.  In particular, the serialization preferences if other than default for the field type would also be specified here.|

###Modeling and Filter impacts

###Tips and Tricks for GUI Views

###REST Support

Currently we are using an external plugin for Django to provide the
hooks for our REST framework: http://django-rest-framework.org/

####Interacting with the REST Framework

Once the rest framework has been installed on the base django system,
the system is now capable of registering and responding to direct HTTP
requests.

In order to declare certain models, and certain attributes within
those models as participating in the REST interface, the developer
needs to:

1. Create a serializer for the model
2. Create views for the model
3. Register URLs/hierarchies to be part of the REST api

####About Serializers

Serializers are required in order to properly pack and unpack data
that is being exchanged via the HTTP requests.  Go to the
/opt/planetstack/core/serializers.py

####About REST Views

Our convention is to make user of GenericAPI views for each of the
objects. This will automatically map GET, POST, PUT, DELETE -
including patch behavior (partial updates).

####About URL registrations

There is a good quick start guide available on the
django-rest-framework site for further details:
http://django-rest-framework.org/#quickstart
